A fun experiment to generate diptychs of images in a localised browser environment. Designed to be used with a code editor and previewed on a local host.

If you are unfamiliar with the code and want to have a go, please visit this code-sandbox url and replace the images in the folder with your own images.

Simply replace the images in the 'img' and 'img2 folder'

Make sure to rename the images to 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg,......10.jpg The code currently supports 10 images in each folder. This can be changed by adding more to the array of each ( follow format of example is unsure how )
