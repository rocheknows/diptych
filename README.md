<!-- Random Diptych generator for artists.

A fun experiment to generate dyptychs of images in a localised browser environment.
Designed to be used with a code editor and previewied on a local host.

If you are unfamiliar with code and want to have a go, please visit this codesandbox url and replace the images in the folder with your own images.

Simply replace the images in the 'img' and 'img2 folder'

- Make sure to rename the images to 1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg,......10.jpg
- Code currently supports 10 images in each folder. This can be changed by adding more to the array of each ( follow format of example is unsure how ) -->
